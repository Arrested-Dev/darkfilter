Darkfilter for PD2 S5

Darkfilter is effectively a highlight system filter for PD2 and exists to cut out mostly trash items and highlight those worth your attention.
Tiering of items has been curated by DarkHumility, and the filter itself is the work of ADevelopment.

Hop on by to watch DarkHumility stream at twitch.tv/DarkHumility (almost 365 days a year, if it's not PD2 content, it's D2 content of some kind)
and you can find Adevelopment on the rare occasions he streams at twitch.tv/Adevelopment (otherwise to be found making smart-ass comments in POE streams)
